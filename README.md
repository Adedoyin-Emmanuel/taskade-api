# Task API ðŸš€

This is a simple **Task API** I wanted to build real quick. Just as the name implies, it is a task management API where users can sign up, login and then create tasks, just the basic stuff. I can turn this into a big project but let's make it really simple just to wrap my head around **Prisma** again. This is a project to refresh my knowledge of **Prisma**. Though I used **Prisma** to build an **Event Management API** during **HNGX**. I will also be using **Docker** to containerize this **API**. I will be using **PostgreSQL** as the DB. Let's goo.
