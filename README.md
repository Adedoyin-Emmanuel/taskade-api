# Task API ðŸš€

This is a simple **Task API** I wanted to build real quick. Just as the name implies, it is a task management API where users can sign up, login and then create tasks, just the basic stuff. I can turn this into a big project but let's make it really simple just to wrap my head around **Prisma** again. This is a project to refresh my knowledge of **Prisma**. Though I used **Prisma** to build an **Event Management API** during **HNGX**. I will also be using **Docker** to containerize this **API**. I will be using **PostgreSQL** as the DB. Let's goo.

## Why Prisma ðŸ¤”

Prisma is a popular and powerful **ORM**. The ability to write a db query that works on most relational databases and even non relational databases is such a powerful feature to comprehend.
Kudos to the **Prisma** team. Though I've used **Prisma** in the past to build an **Event API** during **HNGX**, I still wanted to take time to practice it personally. Prisma is really awesome
.

## Resources ðŸ¥„

As usual, where else do I've ðŸ˜†. I used **Youtube** to learn. I watched 3 several crash courses on **Prisma**. I will provide the links to the videos later. After learning, I studied a Senior developer codebase (Akinkunmi) and (Benaiah Alumona) to understand how it works and all in a production environment and a product used by a lot of users. I also studied **Prisma** docs to understand how it works and go beyond the **Youtube Videos** you absolutely need to read the docs.

- [Prisma Zero To Hero By Sakura Dev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW6HnMUAWNU&pp=ygUTcHJpc21hIGNyYXNoIGNvdXJzZQ%3D%3D)

I watched those 3 videos, then read the docs and started building. It was even hard at all.
Btw, I ran into some errors and I had to refer back to the videos and docs. So yeah....

## What's next?ðŸ¤”

Build, build build, read more docs and tweet about what I learn. I will also build a frontend of this with **NextJs, Radix-Ui or SchadCn UI**. I also plan to also write **Prisma** with nextJs soon. Since this is just an **API** or better still, use **Prisma** with **GraphQL** in my **GraphQL Journey Repo**. That sounds nice. Thanks for reading, I hope this inspires you.
